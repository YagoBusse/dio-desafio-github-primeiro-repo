Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. He's a peeping tom. Dad. Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine.<br>Never? But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. Okay.</p>
